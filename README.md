# SRCNN-google-colaboratory-tutorial
#### This repository is a tutorial to get started in the field of super resolution and deep learning and google colaboratory.
#### The super resolution model used is **SRCNN**.
#### The code uses:
######     Python version 3.7.12
######     Numpy version 1.19.5
######     Tensorflow version 2.6.0 
#### The original github repository is [https://github.com/MarkPrecursor/SRCNN-keras](url).
# Super resolution
#### It is the process of converting a low resolution image of video into high resolution one.
#### There are number of methodes to do this, but deep learning methods have shown significant results.
#### There are different models to do super resolution, one of tem is the SRCNN.
#### This model is a very simple model that uses 3 convolution layers.
#### you can view SRCNN paper in [https://arxiv.org/abs/1501.00092](url).
